**üîÑ Project Process:-**

  - Collected Diwali sales data from a retail dataset (Excel format).
  - Set up Python environment using Jupyter Notebook.
  - Imported essential libraries like `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`.
  - Removed null, duplicate, and irrelevant records.
  - Handled missing values and corrected data types.
  - Filtered out unnecessary columns..
  - Used visualizations (bar charts, histograms, pie charts) to understand patterns.
  - Analyzed data based on gender, age group, occupation, city, and product categories.
  - Identified which customer segments spent the most.
  - Highlighted top-selling products and high-revenue regions.
  - Designed dashboards and summary visuals within Jupyter for better storytelling.
  - Provided actionable recommendations for future Diwali marketing and sales strategies.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Challenges Faced & Solutions :-**

1. **Missing or Null Values in Dataset :-**
- **Challenge**: Several records had missing values (e.g., in gender, age, or product category).
- **Solution**: Used `pandas` to drop or impute missing data using methods like `.dropna()` or `.fillna()` depending on context.

2. **Inconsistent Data Formats :-**
- **Challenge**: Inconsistent formatting in columns like date, age ranges, or categorical values.
- **Solution**: Standardized formats using string manipulation, regex, and data type conversions with `pandas`.
  
3. **Duplicate Records :-**
- **Challenge**: Duplicate rows affected accuracy in analysis and visualization.
- **Solution**: Removed duplicate records using `drop_duplicates()` function in pandas.

4. **Unstructured or Noisy Data :-**
- **Challenge**: Some entries included irrelevant or noisy data (e.g., symbols, typos).
- **Solution**: Cleaned data using string operations and conditional filtering in Python.

5. **Overlapping Categories or Irrelevant Columns :-**
- **Challenge**: Dataset had redundant or unneeded columns.
- **Solution**: Dropped irrelevant features after performing correlation and importance analysis.
